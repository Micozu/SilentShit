## 💥 SilentShit — The Ultimate Server Destroyer

**SilentShit** is a free, open-source FiveM trolling tool designed for *pure chaos*. Drop it into any server (with access, of course) and unleash hell. Whether you're stress testing, proving a point, or just want to watch the world burn — this is your go-to.

### 🔧 What it does:
- Massively disruptive actions
- UI control for quick chaos
- Server-side and client-side destruction tools
- Totally unhinged and meant for destruction

### 🛠️ Open for Forks
This project is fully open-source. Fork it, break it more, fix it (if you dare), or evolve it into something even more *unstable*. Contributions, pull requests, and unholy improvements are welcome.

### ⚠️ Warning
This is **not** meant for legitimate servers or any kind of ethical gameplay. Use at your own risk. This project exists purely for *educational* and *entertainment* purposes (wink).
